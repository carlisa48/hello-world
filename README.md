# hello-world

Hi Everyone,

I'm learning something new. I hope this adds to my income level, in some type of way. I hope to gain knowledge to become a much better provider for my family. I hope this has nothing to do with my unemployment benefits!

I created a repository, then I created a branch, which is a master, the I made and committed changes.
